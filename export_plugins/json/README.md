### Export JSON Plugin

The 'json' Export Plugin allows users to export annotated tables from Wikidata into JSON triples. This plugin processes tables annotated with Wikidata properties and values, converting them into a structured JSON format that represents each cell's data as subject-predicate-object triples. It simplifies data extraction and integration for developers and researchers working with linked data and semantic web applications.
